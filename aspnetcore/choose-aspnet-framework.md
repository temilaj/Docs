# Choose between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core 

No matter the web application you are creating, ASP.NET has a solution for you: from enterprise web applications targeting Windows Server, to small microservices targeting Linux containers, and everything in between.

## ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web applications on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## ASP.NET

ASP.NET is a mature framework that provides all the services needed to build enterprise-class, server-based web applications on Windows.
