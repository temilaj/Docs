# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core 1.1

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are for ASP.NET Core 1.1. Looking for the latest version? See [the current version of this tutorial](xref:getting-started).

1. Install the .NET Core **SDK Installer** for SDK 1.0.4 from the [.NET Core 1.0.5 & 1.1.2 SDK 1.0.4 downloads page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.5-download.md).

2. Create a folder for a new .NET Core project.

   On macOS and Linux, open a terminal window. On Windows, open a command prompt.

   ```terminal
   mkdir aspnetcoreapp
   cd aspnetcoreapp
   ```

2. If you have installed a later SDK version on your machine, create a *global.json* file to select the 1.0.4 SDK.

   ```json
   {
     "sdk": { "version": "1.0.4" }
   }
   ```

2. Create a new .NET Core project.

   ```terminal
   dotnet new web
   ```
   
3.  Restore the packages.

    ```terminal
    dotnet restore
    ```

4. Run the app.

   The `dotnet run` command builds the app first if needed.

   ```terminal
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Browse to `http://localhost:5000`
