# Get Started with ASP.NET Core

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are for the latest version of ASP.NET Core. Looking to get started with an earlier version? See [the 1.1 version of this tutorial](xref:getting-started-1.1).

1. Install [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/).

2. Create a new .NET Core project.

   On macOS and Linux, open a terminal window. On Windows, open a command prompt. Enter the following command:

    ```terminal
    dotnet new razor -o aspnetcoreapp
    ```
    
4. Run the app.

    Use the following commands to run the app:

    ```terminal
    cd aspnetcoreapp
    dotnet run
    ```

5. Browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

6. Open *Pages/About.cshtml* and modify the page to display the message "Hello, world! The time on the server is @DateTime.Now ":

    [!code-html[Main](getting-started/sample/getting-started/about.cshtml?highlight=9&range=1-9)]

7. Browse to [http://localhost:5000/About](http://localhost:5000/About) and verify the changes.
