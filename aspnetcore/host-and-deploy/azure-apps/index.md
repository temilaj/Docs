# Host ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service

[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) is a [Microsoft cloud computing platform service](https://azure.microsoft.com/) for hosting web apps, including ASP.NET Core.

## Useful resources

The Azure [Web Apps Documentation](/azure/app-service/) is the home for Azure Apps documentation, tutorials, samples, how-to guides, and other resources. Two notable tutorials that pertain to hosting ASP.NET Core apps are:

[Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet)  
Use Visual Studio to create and deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service on Windows.

[Quickstart: Create a .NET Core web app in App Service on Linux](/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-dotnetcore)  
Use the command line to create and deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service on Linux.

The following articles are available in ASP.NET Core documentation:

[Publish to Azure with Visual Studio](xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs)  
Learn how to publish an ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service using Visual Studio.

[Publish to Azure with CLI tools](xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-cli)  
Learn how to publish an ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service using the Git command-line client.

[Continuous deployment to Azure with Visual Studio and Git](xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/azure-continuous-deployment)  
Learn how to create an ASP.NET Core web app using Visual Studio and deploy it to Azure App Service using Git for continuous deployment.

[Continuous deployment to Azure with VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/build/aspnet/core/quick-to-azure)  
Set up a CI build for an ASP.NET Core app, then create a continuous deployment release to Azure App Service.

## Application configuration

With ASP.NET Core 2.0 and later, three packages in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage) provide automatic logging features for apps deployed to Azure App Service:

* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServices.HostingStartup](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServices.HostingStartup/) uses [IHostingStartup](xref:host-and-deploy/platform-specific-configuration) to provide ASP.NET Core lightup integration with Azure App Service. The added logging features are provided by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration` package.
* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration/) executes [AddAzureWebAppDiagnostics](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.azureappservicesloggerfactoryextensions.addazurewebappdiagnostics) to add Azure App Service diagnostics logging providers in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` package.
* [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices/) provides logger implementations to support Azure App Service diagnostics logs and log streaming features.

## Monitoring and logging

For monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting information, see the following articles:

[How to: Monitor Apps in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/web-sites-monitor)  
Learn how to review quotas and metrics for apps and App Service plans.

[Enable diagnostics logging for web apps in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log)  
Discover how to enable and access diagnostic logging for HTTP status codes, failed requests, and web server activity.

[Introduction to Error Handling in ASP.NET Core](xref:fundamentals/error-handling)  
Understand common appoaches to handling errors in ASP.NET Core apps.

[Troubleshoot ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service](xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/troubleshoot)  
Learn how to diagnose issues with Azure App Service deployments with ASP.NET Core apps.

[Common errors reference for Azure App Service and IIS with ASP.NET Core](xref:host-and-deploy/azure-iis-errors-reference)  
See the common deployment configuration errors for apps hosted by Azure App Service/IIS with troubleshooting advice.

## Data Protection key ring and deployment slots

[Data Protection keys](xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-management#data-protection-implementation-key-management) are persisted to the *%HOME%\ASP.NET\DataProtection-Keys* folder. This folder is backed by network storage and is synchronized across all machines hosting the app. Keys aren't protected at rest. This folder supplies the key ring to all instances of an app in a single deployment slot. Separate deployment slots, such as Staging and Production, don't share a key ring.

When swapping between deployment slots, any system using data protection won't be able to decrypt stored data using the key ring inside the previous slot. ASP.NET Cookie Middleware uses data protection to protect its cookies. This leads to users being signed out of an app that uses the standard ASP.NET Cookie Middleware. For a slot-independent key ring solution, use an external key ring provider, such as:

* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Key Vault
* SQL store
* Redis cache

For more information, see [Key storage providers](xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-storage-providers).
