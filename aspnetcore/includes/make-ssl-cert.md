For generating self-signed SSL certificates on Windows, you can use the PowerShell cmdlet [New-SelfSignedCertificate](/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=win10-ps). For a third-party tool that makes it easier for you to generate self-signed certificates, see [SelfCert](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/selfcert-create-a-self-signed-certificate-interactively-gui-or-programmatically-in-net).

On macOS and Linux you can create a self-signed certificate using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).
