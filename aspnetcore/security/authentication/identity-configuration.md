# Configure Identity

ASP.NET Core Identity has common behaviors in applications such as password policy, lockout time, and cookie settings that you can override easily in your application's `Startup` class.

## Passwords policy

By default, Identity requires that passwords contain an uppercase character, lowercase character, a digit, and a non-alphanumeric character. There are also some other restrictions. To simplify password restrictions, modify the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class of your application.

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x)

ASP.NET Core 2.0 added the `RequiredUniqueChars` property. Otherwise, the options are the same from ASP.NET Core 1.x.

[!code-csharp[Main](identity/sample/src/ASPNETv2-IdentityDemo-Configuration/Startup.cs?range=29-37,50-52)]

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x)

[!code-csharp[Main](identity/sample/src/ASPNET-IdentityDemo-PrimaryKeysConfig/Startup.cs?range=58-65,84)]

`IdentityOptions.Password` has the following properties:

| Property                | Description                       | Default |

| `RequiredUniqueChars`   | Requires the number of distinct characters in the password. | 1 |


## User's lockout

| `AllowedForNewUsers` | Determines if a new user can be locked out.  | true |

## Sign in settings

## User validation settings

`IdentityOptions.User` has the following properties:

| `AllowedUserNameCharacters`  | Allowed characters in the username. | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-._@+ |


## Application's cookie settings

Like the passwords policy, all the settings of the application's cookie can be changed in the `Startup` class.

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x)

Under `ConfigureServices` in the `Startup` class, you can configure the application's cookie.

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x)
